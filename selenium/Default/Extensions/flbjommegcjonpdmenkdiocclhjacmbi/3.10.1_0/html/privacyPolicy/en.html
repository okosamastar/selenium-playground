        <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the <strong>HeadingsMap</strong> and <strong>WCAG Contrast Checker</strong> browser
            extensions and is intended to inform users about the permissions they require to work and the reasons why they are
            required.</p>
        <h3>No data collection</h3>
        <p>The browser extensions <strong>HeadingsMap</strong> and <strong>WCAG Contrast Checker</strong> do not collect any data
            from any website. They only perform HTML analysis in the browser side (client side) using vanilla javascript
            (without the use of third party libraries of frameworks) and do not collect, save or share any data from the web
            documents.</p>
        <p>They were developed, and are maintained, for helping and supporting developers, consultants, quality auditors or any
            other end user on their daily use/work. There are no hidden intents.</p>
        <h3>Browser permissions</h3>
        <p><strong>HeadingsMap</strong> and <strong>WCAG Contrast Checker</strong> access the HTML of the page that is
            currently displayed by the browser, either the content directly descended from the html tag, as well as the
            documents that are included by the use of iframes. For this reason, and also because it gives the user a set of
            options and preferences that can be saved (theme, panel position, type of analysis, error identification, etc.), it
            requires some specific permissions from the browser to work.</p>

        <p>None of the permissions that the extensions require collect data from any website. They are required to perform the
            html analysis, give the user information about the html and the styles that it has applied to its elements, and
            give the user a set of options to define the way in which he/she wants to perform the analysis and how to show the
            results. There is no data collection from the contents and there is no data collection about the sites in which the
            user uses the extensions. In addition, the extensions do not perform any action while they are not in execution.</p>

        <p>This is the list of browser permissions and the reasons why they are required:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>all_urls</dt>
            <dd>This permission allows the extensions to work on any URL because it matches any URL that uses a permitted
                scheme
            </dd>
            <dt>activeTab</dt>
            <dd>The <code>activeTab</code> permission grants temporary access to the site the user is on and allows the
                extension to use the "tabs" permission on the current tab. This permission displays no warning on installation.
                This is used by the extension to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Call <code>tabs.executeScript</code> and <code>tabs.insertCSS</code> on the current tab. The script
                        execution is required to analyse the DOM and the insertion of CSS is required to style the panel and to
                        highlight the elements (feature that the extensions have that consist on highlight the elements in the
                        page when selecting their information in the panel)
                    </li>
                    <li>Get the URL and the title the tab via an API that returns a <code>tabs.Tab</code> object. The only
                        reason for getting this information is to show to the user the html documents that he/she is watching
                        and give the option to decide (by selecting it in a custom selector that shows their title) in which one
                        the analysis must be performed.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </dd>
            <dt>storage</dt>
            <dd>Enables extensions to store and retrieve data in the browser (not in any remote place or server), and listen for
                changes to stored items. This feature is used by the extension to save and retrieve the user preferences, like
                the panel disposition, theme, error warnings, etc.
            </dd>
            <dt>webNavigation</dt>
            <dd>Add event listeners for the various stages of a navigation. A navigation consists of a frame in the browser
                transitioning from one URL to another, usually (but not always) in response to a user action like clicking a
                link or entering a URL in the location bar.
