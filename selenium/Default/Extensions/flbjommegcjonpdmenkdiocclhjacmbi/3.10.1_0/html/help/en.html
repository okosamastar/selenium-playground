    <div class="contents custom-scrollbar">
        <p>HeadingsMap is a browser extension whose main function is to be a tool for displaying the header structure of
            web pages and identify potential errors, helping in audits of accessibility, quality, SEO,...</p>
        <p>The extension checks the document to identify the structure of headers and sections and shows the results in
            a tree according to the document hierarchy.</p>
        <h3>Features</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Shows a list of headings with information about their level and if they break the hierarchical
                structure
            </li>
            <li>If there are elements that use <em>role</em> attribute with value <em>heading</em>, they are also
                listed. Their level is based on the value of <em>aria-level</em> attribute (if not defined, its default
                is 2).
            </li>
            <li>List of sections with header information and warnings for errors in the structure</li>
            <li>Gets the information from the main document and also from the documents inside iframes (includes a
                document selector that is active when there are multiple documents)
            </li>
            <li>By clicking on the headers, the document scrolls to the position of the header/section and highlights
                it
            </li>
            <li>Detects changes in the DOM and when they finish it updates the trees</li>
            <li>Dark theme (optional)</li>
            <li>HTML 5 Outline test is optional</li>
            <li>Optionally it shows hidden headers and sections (hidden for assistive technologies). When they are
                shown, an icon is added to the items in the tree to identify which ones were detected as visible or
                hidden by the extension
            </li>
            <li>If the header (or section) is an anchor, the link in the results has the href pointing to it (useful for
                being copied directly from the tree with the option in the contextual menu of the browser)
            </li>
            <li>If header/section content uses aria-label, its value can be shown (optional property configurable in the
                settings section)
            </li>
            <li>Version for multiple browsers. It uses the "browserExtensions API" so it is compatible with Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge,...
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>HeadingsMap tree - settings</h3>
        <dl>
            <dt>Error if not initial h1</dt>
            <dd>It is commonly accepted that the first header in the document must be an h1. With this option
                active, and "identify errors" as well, the lack on this rule is considered error
            </dd>
            <dt>Heading level</dt>
            <dd>It includes the heading level (1 to 6) that is used as tag (h1 to h6)</dd>
            </dd>
            <dt>Consider hidden headers</dt>
            <dd>When the document includes headers that are hidden for any tool (not only visually hidden, but
                also hidden for assistive technologies), they are not shown in the tree. When activating
                this option, they are also shown
            </dd>
            <dt>Identify anchors</dt>
            <dd>When the headers include anchors, they show an icon in the tree. Clicking the icon copies the URL
                address to the clipboard (same as "copy link address" action from the browser)
            </dd>
        </dl>
        <h3>HTML 5 outline - settings</h3>
        <p>According to the W3C, there are not browsers or assistive technologies that support it, so having a good
            result in the test barely impact in the final accessibility. According to the W3C, any implementation and
            usage of these different proposals will be tracked, and may result in significant future changes to the
            outline algorithm.
        </p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Show section index</dt>
            <dd>According to the algorithm, each section would have an index in the tree. This setting shows/hides that
                value
            </dd>
            <dt>Show section tag</dt>
            <dd>With this setting, the tree shows the HTML tag that <a
                    href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-author-20110809/headings-and-sections.html#outlines"
                    target="_blank">generates the sections</a>.
            </dd>
            <dt>Consider hidden sections</dt>
            <dd>When the document includes hidden sections (not only visually hidden, but
                also hidden for assistive technologies), they are not shown in the tree. When activating
                this option, they are shown. In long documents, this could affect to the performance since it requires
                to check all elements in the DOM
            </dd>
            <dt>Consider HGROUP</dt>
            <dd>When activated, it considers the element HGROUP as heading element. According to its behavior, it takes
                the highest heading level as level and in the outline the heading elements that contains are not
                considered
            </dd>
